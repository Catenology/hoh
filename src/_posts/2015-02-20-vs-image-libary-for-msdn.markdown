I design the database schema and the database report layout for the index files that are published with Visual Studio Image Library every year.

<!--more-->

The image library includes all image assets that are shipped in Visual Studio IDE and an index to describe each asset. It is published on MSDN every year for Visual Studio developers to download. I use Excel and PowerShell scripts to streamline the data-entry process for descriptive metadata for each asset. The pdf format database report layout is designed and generated with Adobe Indesign.

#### The dictionary index is a query result of all commonly used images and their usage instructions

#### The all icons index is a query result of all icons shipped in that year and their keywords for searching
